# SolarPumpController

This project uses a PSOC mixed-signal array to control a three-phase motor drive, 
capable of operating a submersible water pump directly from solar panels.

he PSOC is responsible for 3ÔÅ¶ PWM generation, signal conditioning, over-current and fault protection, 
temperature monitoring, constant voltage-to-frequency control, and   maximizing the power from the solar array.
